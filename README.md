# Egghead.io-Keyboard-Shortcuts
Add keyboard shortcuts to pause, play, forward, backward, next and previous videos on Egghead.io

Shortcut Defaults are set to:
    *Pause/Play: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + 7
    *Back Ten Seconds: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + 8
    *Forward Twenty Five Seconds: Ctrl/Cmd Shift 9
    *Next: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + 0
    *Previous: undefined

These defaults are set this way due to restrictions set by Chrome upon developers. You can change bindings by going to 'chrome://extensions', scrolling to the bottom, and clicking 'Keyboard Shortcuts'

Happy Hacking!
